## Project Title
Cab Data PipeLine using Databricks and pySpark

## Project Description
In this project we have taken a Combined Data set which is not in it's [Normalised](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/normalization-process-in-dbms/) form. We have made a [Data Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-modeling-a-comprehensive-guide-for-analysts/) which is basically a [Star Schema](https://github.com/everysemicoloncounts/Data-Engineering-Projects/blob/main/Uber%20Data%20Analysis%20Project/data_model.jpeg). We have taken the raw Data and broken it into smaller Dimension Table and a Fact Table.

## Usage of the Project
We can consider this as an ETL Development project which can be considered as a upstream of a Data Analysis pipeline. We can use the Dimension Tables and Fact Tables to create Impactful Analytics Dashboards.
